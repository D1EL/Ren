> This is a weekend hack project inspired by '[Trif](http://trif.it)', built in a day or so. It uses the web audio API to analyse an incoming audio stream (coming from SoundCloud), to toggle the visibility of some trippy gifs. There's also a hidden feature..somewhere..

## Running locally

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`, which will kickstart webpack-dev-server
- It should now be up and running at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> ⚠️ This project contains rapidly flickering images.
